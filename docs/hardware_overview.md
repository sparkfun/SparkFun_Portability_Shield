## OLED
The 1.3" OLED is a small, monochrome, blue on black display with a 128 x 64 dot matrix panel and a 7-bit unshifted I<sup>2</sup>C address of 0x3D. To change the I<sup>2</sup>C address to 0x3C, cut the D/C jumper on the back of the board. For more information, refer to the [datasheet](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/0/8/SSD1306.pdf).

## GPIO Expander

The TCA9554 GPIO Expander is used for I<sup>2</sup>C interfacing with the Navigation Switch, 1.3" OLED display, the fuel gauge, and the SD Card Detect. Its 7-bit unshifted address is 0x20.

## Power

Power is provided by either the LiPo Battery or the 5V/GND pins. Maximum input to the board is 5V.

## Current Measurement 

There are two plated through holes available on the bottom of the board to measure current if desired.

## Fuel Gauge

The MAX17048 uses the Li+ battery-modeling algorithm ModelGaugeâ„¢ to track the battery relative state-of-charge (SOC) continuously over widely varying charge and discharge conditions. This eliminates current-sense resistor and battery learn cycles required in traditional fuel gauges and allows for the most accurate battery percentage readings. Its 7-bit unshifted address is 0x36. For more information, you can refer to the [datasheet](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/5/2/7/6/6/MAX17048-MAX17049.pdf).

## LiPo Charging Circuit

The charge circuit charges Li+ batteries at 500mA. The equation below shows our calculation for this rate.

## MicroSD Card

The microSD Socket Friction Fit slot allows for data logging or easy upload of programming files. 

!!! warning
	Do NOT drive the microSD card pins high if the card is not powered. Damage could occur!

## Shield Connectors

The offset PTHs allow for a snug fit when soldering headers to the board. Once male headers are soldered in, the SparkFun Portability Shield can be fit to the main board of choice. 

If <b>5V</b> is present, LiPo charging commences. Below <b>5V</b>, the battery will provide VBATT to the mainboard 3.3V is not provided to mainboard - 5V/VBATT powers local 3.3V_P.

## Jumpers


* <b>CHG:</b>
    Cutting this jumper will disconnect the power to the CHG LED on the front of the board. 

* <b>PWR:</b>
    Cutting this jumper will disconnect the power to the PWR LED on the front of the board. 

* <b>D/C:</b>
    Cutting this jumper will change the I<sup>2</sup>C address from 0x3D to 0x3C.

* <b>I<sup>2</sup>C:</b>
	The SparkFun Portability Shield has built-in 2.2k pull-up resistors on the SDA and SCL lines. These are needed for normal I<sup>2</sup>C communication. The I<sup>2</sup>C jumper has two small traces connecting the pull-ups to 3.3V. **For general use you can leave this jumper unmodified.** If you have many (over 7) devices on the I<sup>2</sup>C bus, each with their own pull up resistors, then you may want to [cut the I<sup>2</sup>C jumpers](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-work-with-jumper-pads-and-pcb-traces) to disconnect the 2.2k resistors on each Qwiic board.
