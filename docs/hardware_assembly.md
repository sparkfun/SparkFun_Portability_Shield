The Portability Shield has been designed to be usable with any compatible main board. Here we have soldered in headers and it is plugged into the [RTK Postcard](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/26916). Note that there is an antenna attached to the module, as well as a LiPo battery plugged into the JST port.
